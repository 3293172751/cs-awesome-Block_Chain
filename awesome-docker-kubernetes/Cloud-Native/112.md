## Enhance the Service Health Check Mechanism

**Description:**

In our current mechanism to check the health status of various services (MySQL, MongoDB, Minio, etc.), there's a possibility to enhance its maintainability and flexibility:

**Current Behavior:**

1. The configuration file's path is hardcoded.
2. Each service's health check status is verified with individual code blocks, leading to redundancy.
3. Error handling can be streamlined for better clarity.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. Implement command-line flags to allow users to specify the configuration file's path.
2. Utilize a unified function array structure to iterate through all checks, thus reducing redundancy.
3. Refactor error handling to make the code clearer and more concise.



# OpenIM PR Bug About Actions

**Description**:

This PR aims to fix the current actions in OpenIM that are not passing. The problematic actions identified include `go lint`, `opeim start`, and `make install`.

**Changes**:

1. **Go Lint**: Adjusted [specific files or changes you made to pass the linting process].
2. **Opeim Start**: Resolved the issue by [specific fixes related to the start process, maybe configuration changes or other adjustments].
3. **Make Install**: Fixed the installation process by [details of the changes you made, perhaps regarding dependencies or paths].

**Testing**:

- Ran `go lint` and ensured all files now pass without warnings or errors.
- Executed `opeim start` to confirm the start process initializes without hitches.
- Performed `make install` to validate that the installation completes successfully.
