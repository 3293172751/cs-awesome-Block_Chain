## Enhance the Service Health Check Mechanism

**Description:**

In our current mechanism to check the health status of various services (MySQL, MongoDB, Minio, etc.), there's a possibility to enhance its maintainability and flexibility:

**Current Behavior:**

1. The configuration file's path is hardcoded.
2. Each service's health check status is verified with individual code blocks, leading to redundancy.
3. Error handling can be streamlined for better clarity.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. Implement command-line flags to allow users to specify the configuration file's path.
2. Utilize a unified function array structure to iterate through all checks, thus reducing redundancy.
3. Refactor error handling to make the code clearer and more concise.
