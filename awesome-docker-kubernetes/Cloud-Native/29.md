## Learn  GitHub modify someone else's pull request and commit

 Sometimes we need to make some changes to the pull request that community developers submit to our project, such as some configuration files and resource files. In this case we can respond directly to the request to make the change, but instead we can use a simpler solution: **we can directly commit to the pull request.**

 I'll take this warehouse as an example~

As a classic example, this pr and tutorial is very helpful in regulating the development process.

**First, **Find the pull request branch name that needs to be modified:

+ VinceCui:feat/support-nvidia-docker-and-nonroot

![image-20230218181350175](http://sm.nsddd.top/sm202302181813288.png)



### Add remote repository

**First you need to add the `pull request` author's repository locally as another remote repository: **

+ https://github.com/VinceCui/sealer/tree/feat/support-nvidia-docker-and-nonroot

![image-20230218183733938](http://sm.nsddd.top/sm202302181837003.png)

```bash
$ git remote set-url VinceCui https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/VinceCui/sealer/
```



**Synchronize warehouse and update remote warehouse content: **

```bash
$ git fetch VinceCui feat/support-nvidia-docker-and-nonroot
```



**After the synchronization is complete, we need to switch to the branch from which the other party initiated the pull request, which is the branch from which we want to commit the new commit: **

```bash
$ git checkout -b VinceCui VinceCui/feat/support-nvidia-docker-and-nonroot
```



**Submitted and modified: **

After switching to `VinceCui/feat` branch, the file changes can be made, and the commit process is the same as usual:

```bash
$ git commit -a -s -m "feat: something"
```



Once you've made sure the changes are complete and committed, push them to the other repository. Pay attention to the push target branch here, git may prompt inconsistent branch name, just push as prompted:

```bash
git push VinceCui HEAD:main
```



Once the push is complete, you should be able to see the change on the GitHub pull request page.

#### resolve

Resolved issue: [#1491](https://github.com/sealerio/sealer/issues/1491)、[#1999](https://github.com/sealerio/sealer/issues/1999)

**Resolved remote read permission to `sshd_config` file:**

```bash
$ ls -al /etc/ssh/sshd_config
-rw------- 1 root root 3797 Feb 15 16:35 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```



#### existing problem

+  **Still needs to assign non-secret permissions to user sudo(Every node except master0):**

```bash
# echo "sealer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

+  **The rootless feature of [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) is not addressed:**
