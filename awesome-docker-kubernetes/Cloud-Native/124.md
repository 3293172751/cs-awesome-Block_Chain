# IMCTL 设计技巧

参考 kubectl 以及 [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) 的实现，实际上，复杂的 OpenIM Core 和 Client-GO 的架构比较相近，所以设计中，最重要的是结合 core sdk

思考，如何把它们组织结合起来。



## 架构图

I was reviewing the [link relationship between the app and OpenIM](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server#link-relationship-between-app-and-openim) section in the README, and I believe the architecture diagram can be optimized for better clarity and presentation.

**Suggestions**:

1. **Resolution Enhancement**: Consider increasing the resolution of the image, making sure that the text and elements are clearly visible even on high-DPI displays.
2. **Use of Colors**: Using varied colors can help differentiate between different components of the architecture.
3. **Annotations**: Consider adding more annotations or legends to explain the specific components, especially if there are icons or symbols that might not be immediately recognizable.
4. **Export Formats**: If possible, provide the architecture diagram in vector format like SVG, which scales better on different devices and screens.
5. **Interactive Versions**: For an enhanced user experience, consider creating an interactive version of the diagram, where users can hover over components to get more details.
