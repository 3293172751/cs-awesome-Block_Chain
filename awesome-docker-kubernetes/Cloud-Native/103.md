## :rocket: Quick Start

You can quickly learn OpenIM engineering solutions,  all it takes is one simple command:

```bash
$ make demo
```

ðŸ¤² In order to facilitate the user experience, we have provided a variety of deployment solutions, you can choose your own deployment method according to the list below:

<details>   <summary>Deploying with Docker Compose</summary>

> docker compose will not be maintained in future versions, but it is still the easiest and most convenient way to organize docker compose deployments into a separate project https://github.com/openim-sigs/openim-docker to maintain.

**1. Clone the project**


```bash
# choose what you need, We take branch 3.2 as an example
$ BRANCH=release-v3.2
$ git clone -b $BRANCH https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server openim/openim-server && export openim_dir=$(pwd)/openim && cd ${openim_dir}/openim-server
```

> **Note**
> If you don't know OpenIM's versioning policy, ðŸ“šRead our release policy: https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/version.md



**2. Configure the config file**

If you tried to get started quickly with `make demo`, then you know that our config file is generated by automation.

You can use `make init` to quickly initialize a configuration file

```bash
$ make init
$ git diff
```

Then feel free to modify your current config file,  you can also modify `/scripts/install/environment.sh` document template, `make init` is essentially rendering `environment.sh` template, and then through the `make init` to automatically generate a new configuration.

If you only need to change the config file for a short time, or if you don't want to make any major changes in the future, you can modify the `.env file directly

```bash
USER=root 								#no need to modify
PASSWORD=openIM123  					#A combination of 8 or more numbers and letters, this password applies to redis, mysql, mongo, as well as accessSecret in config/config.yaml
ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:10005 		#minio's external service IP and port, or use the domain name storage.xx.xx, the app must be able to access this IP and port or domain,
API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10002/object/ 	#the app must be able to access this IP and port or domain,
DATA_DIR=./  							#designate large disk directory
```

**3. Deploy and start**

> **Note**
>
> You can deploy either directly with `make install` or with `docker compose up`, the logic is the same

```bash
$ make install
# OR
$ docker-compose up
```

4. Check the service

```bash
$ make check
```

Looking at the command line at this point, there are two items in the output, checking for the start of the component port that OpenIM depends on, and the start of the OpenIM core component

</details> 

<details>  <summary>Compile from Source</summary>

Ur need `Go 1.18` or higher version, and `make`.


```bash
go version && make --version || echo "Error: One of the commands failed."
```

Version Details: https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/version.md

```bash
# choose what you need
$ BRANCH=release-v3.1
$ git clone -b $BRANCH https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server openim && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim && make start
```

> `make help` to help you see the instructions supported by OpenIM.

Use `make check` to check all component starts

```bash
$ make check
```

You can use the `make help-all` see OpenIM in action.

</details>

<details>  <summary>Component Configuration Instructions</summary>
The `config/config.yaml` file has detailed configuration instructions for the storage components.

The config file is available via [environment.sh](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/scripts/install/environment.sh) configuration [openim.yaml](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/deployments/templates/openim.yaml) template, and then through the `make init` to automatically generate a new configuration.

- Zookeeper

  - Used for RPC service discovery and registration, cluster support.

    ```bash
    zookeeper:
      schema: openim                          #Not recommended to modify
      address: [ 127.0.0.1:2181 ]             #address
      username:                               #username
      password:                               #password
    ```

- MySQL

  - Used for storing users, relationships, and groups, supports master-slave database.

    ```bash
    mysql:
