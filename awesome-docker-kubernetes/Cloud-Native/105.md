**Description**:

In order to address the evolving needs of our user base and streamline our development and deployment processes, it's imperative that we implement an automated release and multi-architecture compilation strategy for the Core Repository. This enhancement will not only reduce manual intervention but also ensure compatibility across diverse hardware architectures.

**Objectives**:

1. Automated Release

   : Automate the process of packaging and releasing new versions of the software in the Core Repository. This should include:

   - Version bumping.
   - Change-log generation.
   - Notification to stakeholders.

2. Multi-Architecture Compilation:

   - Ensure that our software is compilable and runs efficiently on multiple hardware architectures.
   - Implement CI/CD checks for common architectures like x86_64, ARM64, etc.
   - Provide documentation for supported architectures and potential pitfalls or optimizations for each.

**Steps**:

1. Evaluate and select appropriate CI/CD tools that support multi-architecture builds (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Travis CI).
2. Implement automated versioning and release workflows.
3. Add compilation steps for different architectures in the CI/CD pipeline.
4. Test builds on actual hardware or emulated environments to ensure proper functionality.
5. Document the new workflows and provide guidelines for contributors and maintainers.

**Additional Information**:

- Any pre-existing tools or scripts that could aid in this transition should be mentioned.
- We might need to consider potential licensing or costs associated with some CI/CD tools.

**Call to Action**: Looking for feedback from the team regarding potential tools to use and any challenges foreseen in implementing this strategy. Contributions, suggestions, and best practices are welcome!
