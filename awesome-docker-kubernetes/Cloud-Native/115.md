# 115: Development of a Diagnostic Tool in Go

**Description:** The goal is to develop a diagnostic tool written in Go to retrieve and display the version numbers of several software components on the local machine, presented in a neat, visually appealing Markdown format.

**Components to be diagnosed:**

1. Go language version
2. Docker version
3. Docker-compose version
4. Kubernetes version
5. OpenIM - both server and client components

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Go language version retrieval:** The tool should be able to fetch the Go language version from the local machine.
2. **Docker and Docker-compose version retrieval:** The tool should be able to determine the version of both Docker and Docker-compose installed on the local machine.
3. **Kubernetes version retrieval:** If Kubernetes is installed, its version should be identifiable by the tool.
4. **OpenIM version retrieval:** The diagnostic tool should fetch the version numbers for both the server and client components of OpenIM.
5. **Markdown formatted output:** The results should be printed in a visually appealing Markdown format.

**Potential Challenges:**

- Handling the absence of any of the mentioned software components on the local machine.
- Ensuring compatibility with different OS platforms.

**Implementation Details:**

- The Go tool can utilize command-line exec capabilities to run commands such as `go version`, `docker version`, etc.
- Error handling should be robust to ensure graceful failures for non-installed components.
- The Markdown formatting can utilize Go's string manipulation capabilities.
