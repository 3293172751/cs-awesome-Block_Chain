# Proposal for Refactoring Plan

## Background

The current codebase is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and scale. To address this, we propose a comprehensive refactoring plan to improve the code quality, maintainability, and scalability of the project.

## Goals

+ Improve the directory structure to better organize the codebase and make it easier to navigate.
+ Design a makefile to automate common tasks and simplify the development process.
+ Implement a CICD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
+ Streamline the development process to make it more efficient and effective.
+ Design a logging system to capture important events and make it easier to debug issues.
+ Create a contributor's guide to encourage and facilitate contributions from the community.
+ Design a merge strategy to ensure that changes are integrated smoothly and efficiently.

## Plan

### Directory Design

We will reorganize the codebase into a more logical and intuitive directory structure. This will involve grouping related files and folders together and removing unnecessary clutter.

### Makefile Design

We will design a makefile to automate common tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the project. This will make it easier for developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with system-level tasks.

### CICD Actions Design

We will implement a CICD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process. This will involve using tools such as Jenkins and Docker to create a streamlined workflow.

### Development Process Design

We will streamline the development process by implementing best practices such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.

### Logging Design

We will design a logging system to capture important events and make it easier to debug issues. This will involve using tools such as zaps,  as →

### Contributor's Guide Design

We will create a contributor's guide to encourage and facilitate contributions from the community. This will involve providing clear guidelines for submitting code, reporting issues, and contributing to documentation.

### Merge Design

We will design a merge strategy to ensure that changes are integrated smoothly and efficiently. This will involve using tools such as Git and GitHub to manage branches and merge requests.

## Conclusion

By implementing this refactoring plan, we will improve the code quality, maintainability, and scalability of the project. This will make it easier for developers to work on the project and ensure that it remains relevant and useful for years to come.
