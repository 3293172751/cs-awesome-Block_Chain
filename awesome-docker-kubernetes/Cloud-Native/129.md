# 129: minio 的配置

### MinIO Configuration and Usage Guide

#### 1. Overview

MinIO is an object storage server that is API compatible with Amazon S3. It's best suited for storing unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, backups, and container/VM images. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of configuring MinIO with custom settings.

#### 2. Default Configuration

Configuration can be achieved by modifying the default variables in the `./scripts/install/environment.sh` file. However, for more flexibility and dynamic adjustments, setting environment variables is recommended.

#### 3. Setting Up the Environment Variables

##### 3.1. IP Configuration

By default, the system generates the public IP of the machine. To manually set a public or local IP address, use:
```bash
export IP=127.0.0.1
```

##### 3.2. API URL

This is the address your application uses to communicate with MinIO. By default, it uses the public IP. However, you can adjust it to a public domain or another IP.

```bash
export API_URL=127.0.0.1:10002
```

##### 3.3. MinIO Endpoint Configuration

This is the primary address MinIO uses for communications:

```bash
export MINIO_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1"
```

##### 3.4. MinIO Sign Endpoint

For direct external access to stored content:

```bash
export MINIO_SIGN_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1:10005
```

##### 3.5. Modifying MinIO's Port

If you need to adjust MinIO's port from the default:

```bash
export MINIO_PORT="10005"
```

#### 4. Applying the Configuration

After setting your desired environment variables, restart the MinIO server to apply the changes.

#### 5. Verification

It's crucial to verify the configurations by checking the connectivity between your application and MinIO using the set API URL and ensuring that the data can be directly accessed using the `signEndpoint`.

## **OpenIM Data Storage Architecture Guide**

------

### **I. Introduction**

**OpenIM**, a robust instant messaging system, offers flexible data storage solutions tailored for scalability and performance. This guide provides a deep dive into OpenIM's default storage structure, custom storage settings, and Docker volume management.



### **II. OpenIM Default Data Storage Structure**

**A. Overview**

At the heart of OpenIM's data storage are the essential components: Kafka, MNT, MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis. Each serves a distinct purpose and requires specific configuration and data directories for optimal performance.

**B. Directory Structure**

```bash
$ tree components/ -d -L 2
components/
├── kafka
│   ├── config
│   └── data
├── mnt
│   ├── config
│   └── data
├── mongodb
│   └── data
├── mysql
│   └── data
└── redis
    ├── config
    └── data
```



### III. Customizing OpenIM's Data Storage

**A. Setting a Custom Directory**

For organizations with specific storage directory requirements, OpenIM offers the flexibility to specify a custom directory. Follow these steps:

1. Define your custom directory path by setting the `DATA_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
$ export DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/directory"
```

1. Refresh OpenIM's configuration to reflect this change:

```bash
$ make init
```

**Note:** This action will update the configuration to point to the directory you've specified.



### IV. Docker Volume Storage: An Advanced Approach

**A. Why Docker Volumes?**

Docker volumes offer isolated storage solutions, optimizing data persistence and performance. When scaling services in Docker, using volumes ensures that data remains consistent and protected.

**B. Using Docker Volumes with OpenIM**

To launch OpenIM with Docker volume support, execute:

```bash
$ docker compose -f example/volume-all-server.yml up -d
```

With this setup, your OpenIM data is securely mounted onto Docker’s volumes, providing added resilience and scalability.

**C. Managing Docker Volumes**

1. **Listing OpenIM Docker Volumes**

Retrieve a list of Docker volumes associated with OpenIM using:

```bash
$ docker volume ls | grep open-im-server
```

1. **Removing Data**

- For **locally mapped data**: Simply navigate to the appropriate directory and delete the desired files or folders.
- For **Docker volume data**: If you wish to clear data from Docker volumes, employ the command below:

```bash
$ docker volume ls | grep open-im-server | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
```

**Warning:** This action will permanently erase the data. Always ensure you have backups before proceeding.
