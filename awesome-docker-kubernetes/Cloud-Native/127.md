# 127: 标准化 openim go dev，替换 zookeeper 注册中心

# Standardize openim go dev

I've been using the Go module from `github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server`. I've noticed that, as the module has reached version v3.3.0, according to the Go module's versioning semantics, it should have a `/v3` suffix in the import path for the module to be correctly recognized. This is essential for tools like `pkg.go.dev` to map to the correct version number.

Currently, the package at `https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server` isn't recognizing the version correctly due to this missing suffix.

To resolve this, I propose a two-step solution:

1. Add the `/v3` suffix to your module path. This will ensure that the Go toolchain and other related tools understand and recognize the correct version of your module.
2. I'd like to suggest considering changing the URL to a more succinct and potentially branded version: From: `github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server` To: `openim.cc/open-im-server`

By adopting the above changes, the final Go import path would look something like this: `openim.cc/open-im-server/v3`.

I believe these changes will not only enhance the recognition of the correct version but also provide a cleaner and more streamlined module path for developers.



## Replace Zookeeper Dependency in Docker Compose for Modern Kafka

We have recently upgraded to Kafka version 3.5.1 in our Docker Compose setup. Notably, recent versions of Kafka no longer have a dependency on Zookeeper. However, our current Docker Compose file still contains configurations for Zookeeper.

```yaml
  zookeeper:
   image: bitnami/zookeeper:3.8
   container_name: zookeeper
   ports:
    - "${ZOOKEEPER_PORT}:2181"
   volumes:
     - "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime"
   environment:
     - ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes
     - TZ="Asia/Shanghai"
   restart: always
   networks:
      server:
        ipv4_address: ${ZOOKEEPER_NETWORK_ADDRESS}

  kafka:
    image: 'bitnami/kafka:3.5.1'
    container_name: kafka
    user: root
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "${KAFKA_PORT}:9094"
    volumes:
      - ./scripts/create_topic.sh:/opt/bitnami/kafka/create_topic.sh
      - ${DATA_DIR}/components/kafka:/bitnami/kafka
    command: >
      bash -c "
      /opt/bitnami/scripts/kafka/run.sh & sleep 5; /opt/bitnami/kafka/create_topic.sh; wait
      "
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
       - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
       - KAFKA_CFG_NODE_ID=0
       - KAFKA_CFG_PROCESS_ROLES=controller,broker
       - KAFKA_CFG_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS=0@<your_host>:9093
       - KAFKA_CFG_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://:9092,CONTROLLER://:9093,EXTERNAL://:9094
       - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,EXTERNAL://${DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY}:${KAFKA_PORT}
       - KAFKA_CFG_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP=CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT
       - KAFKA_CFG_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES=CONTROLLER
    networks:
      server:
        ipv4_address: ${KAFKA_NETWORK_ADDRESS}
```

Given this change, we should consider replacing Zookeeper to modernize our Kafka setup and possibly reduce resource overhead. One known alternative is Kraft. However, we are open to suggestions on other alternatives.

**Requirements**:

1. Identify potential alternatives to Zookeeper for Kafka.
2. Compare the pros and cons of each alternative.
3. Update Docker Compose file to reflect the new setup.

**Potential Alternatives**:

1. **Kraft**:
   - Pros:
     - Native to Kafka: Simplifies Kafka setup and reduces external dependencies.
     - Improved stability and fewer moving parts.
   - Cons:
     - Might require some changes to our current scripts and configuration.
     - Need to validate its stability and performance in our specific use case.
