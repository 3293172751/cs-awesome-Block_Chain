## 信息

On December 21, 2022, it was reported that the Network File System (NFS) provides a solution for sharing files for enterprises with heterogeneous environments, including Windows.

On June 26, 2018, instructions were given on how to install the NFS client (services for NFS) on Windows. The user needs to open the "Programs and Features" section, click on "Turn Windows features on or off," and select the NFS client option.

On October 16, 2018, it was suggested that to enable the NFS client, users can use the Programs and Components management tool, "appwiz.cpl." The NFS client option can be found under the list of "components."



**To mount NFS on Windows 10, you need to follow these steps:**

1. Install the NFS Client on your Windows 10 computer. You can do this by going to "Programs and Features" and selecting "Turn Windows Features on or off". Then select "Services for NFS" and click "OK" to install the NFS Client.
2. After installing the NFS Client, open the "Command Prompt" as an administrator.
3. Use the "mount" command to mount the NFS share. For example, if the NFS server IP address is 192.168.1.100 and the NFS share is located at /mnt/data, use the following command:

```bash
mount -o anon \\192.168.1.100\mnt\data X:
```

In the above command, "X:" is the local drive letter you want to use to access the NFS share. You can choose any available drive letter.

> Once you have successfully mounted the NFS share, you can access it using the local drive letter you assigned in the previous step.

**Note:**  You may need to configure the NFS server to allow access from your Windows 10 computer. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the NFS share.



## Why?

+ [https://github.com/winnfsd/winnfsd](https://github.com/winnfsd/winnfsd)

NFS（Network File System）即网络文件系统，是FreeBSD支持的文件系统中的一种，它允许网络中的计算机之间通过TCP/IP网络共享资源。在NFS的应用中，本地NFS的客户端应用可以透明地读写位于远端NFS服务器上的文件，就像访问本地文件一样。



**以下是NFS的好处：**

1. 节省本地存储空间，将常用的数据存放在一台NFS服务器上且可以通过网络访问，那么本地终端将可以减少自身存储空间的使用。

2. 用户不需要在网络中的每个机器上都建有Home目录，Home目录可以放在NFS服务器上且可以在网络上被访问使用。
3. 一些存储设备如软驱、CDROM和Zip（一种高储存密度的磁盘驱动器与磁盘）等都可以在网络上被别的机器使用。这可以减少整个网络上可移动介质设备的数量。

## Description

WinNFSd is a Network File System V3 (NFS) server for Windows.

You can use any NFS client to mount a directory of Windows and read/write files via NFS v3 protocol. It is useful when you usually access files of Windows on Linux and for especially for virtual machines, since it is much faster than shared folders.

You can also export any folder with an additional alias.

The export of multiple folders is also possible. Just put the shared foldes and an optional alias into a simple text file:

```bash
C:\path\to\a\mount > /alias
C:\path\to\another\mount > /another-alias
```

Then start winnfsd.exe like this: `WinNFSd.exe -pathFile C:\path\to\your\pathfile`
