## Ethereum ETH learning

Like Bitcoin, ethereum's underlying framework is the blockchain protocol, which is essentially a distributed database system that uses cryptography. I suggest taking a look at the **Ethereum Whitepaper (golang programming background required) **

> I think the history of the world can be described in two words: United, united, divided. Blockchain will be the new technology that catalyzes the next era of 'harmony and separation'. The emergence of blockchain has created a new era. Our belief is built on a mathematical algorithm, In math we trust.
